We have setup dev environment for the eNFT project and Polkadot-related development.

Boiler plates based on the Polkadot's official templates were used for each subproejct:

- eNFT substrate: substrate node template
- eNFT parachain: substrate cumulus parachain template
- eNFT substrate frontend: substrate frontend template

Infrastructure: The infrastructure for the current dev environment is configured based on aws and is set up by adding extra storage to m4.large size instance (limited storage error when using default storage).

OS: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS

Rust: v1.53.0

Node: v16.4.1


Other details on the dev envornment can be provided upon request.
